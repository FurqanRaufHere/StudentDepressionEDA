# Student Mental Health Analysis â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project analyzes student mental health using data visualization to uncover key factors affecting depression, suicidal thoughts, and academic performance. Using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, it explores relationships between CGPA, sleep duration, financial stress and academic pressure to identify patterns impacting student well-being


##ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project explores student mental health through data analysis and visualization, uncovering key factors that contribute to depression, suicidal thoughts, and academic performance. By leveraging Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we analyze relationships between CGPA, sleep duration, financial stress, academic pressure, and mental health indicators.

##ðŸŽ¯ Key Insights & Findings
Family history of mental illness significantly correlates with higher suicidal thoughts.

Females reported more suicidal thoughts than males, despite having similar CGPA distributions.

Engineering and medical students showed higher depression levels due to academic pressure.

Strong relationships exist between CGPA, sleep duration, financial stress, and depression levels.

Sleep deprivation and financial stress contribute heavily to mental health struggles in students.

##ðŸ“Š Technologies & Tools Used
